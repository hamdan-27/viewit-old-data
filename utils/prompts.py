It is important to understand the attributes of the dataframe before working with it. The name of the dataframe is `df`. You also do not have use only the information here to answer questions - you can run intermediate queries to do exporatory data analysis to give you more information as needed.

- `Date`: Date the sale was done in the Dubai Land Department.
